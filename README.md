# Homogeneous-Ensemble-random-forest
Homogeneous ensemble random forest is a collection of classifiers of the same type, built upon a different subset of data as we use to do in the Random Forest model. The trees in homogeneous enesemble  are usually of the same type, such as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) or Random Forest Trees.
